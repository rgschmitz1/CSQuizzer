CorrectAnswer: "int [] data = {7, -1, 13, 24, 6}"
Question: |
 Write some code that declares an int array variable named data with elements
 7, -1, 13, 24, and 6.

## There a million different wrong answers, so we can display hint
## if the user decides he/she wants some help;

## Practice it did not specify it wanted an int array, so I appended the
## question to clarify the data type of the array to avoid confusion.
Hint: |
 This question is asking for 5 specific elements in an array
 named data. Think of how to make a new array, but with
 5 specified integers at each index of the array.
