Question: |
 Consider the following code,

 public static int findBiggestProduct(int[] a) {
  int x = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    for (int j = i+1; j < a.length; j++) {
      if (a[i]*a[j] > x) x = a[i]*a[j];
    }
  }
  return x;
 }
 Which of the following is the best characterization
 of its running behavior (e.g. T(n) = the number of
 CPU cycles executed by running findBiggestProduct given
 an array of n random ints) using O-notation?
